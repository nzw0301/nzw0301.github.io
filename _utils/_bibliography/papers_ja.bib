    year = {2014},
    abstract = {{Recently, large amounts of cooking recipes are posted for sharing and searching them by many consumers. Hence there exist some similar recipes which were replaced a part of ingredients. In this study, we propose a replaceable ingredient finding method for modifying recipes by using large amounts of cooking recipes. For achieving the proposed method, we extract ingredients and cooking methods from cooking steps in each recipe. The similarities among ingredients are calculated with the word2vec, which are known as a language model based on neural network. Replaceable ingredients are indicated according to the degree of similarity among ingredients. Our experimental evaluations using several hundred thousand actual recipes demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.}}

    abstract = {{Community Detection in graph is an important technique to be able to extract and analyze social media, co-authorship, co-purchase data, etc. In recent years, there are many possible appilications that deal with large-scale graph data, so it is necessary to develop a scalable community detection method for network size. In this paper, we apply training topic models to graph data by regarding a set of nodes that its dsitance to a node is less than a certain distance as a document, and use the predict distrubution of node by each topic as community membership probabilities. We propose a method to use stochastic variational Bayes algorithm for training topic models, which makes the overlapping community detection efficient with high scalability for network size. In the experiment, we show that our proposed method is remarkably faster that previous methods and capable to detect communities even in a huge network that contains 60 million nodes and 1.8 billion edges. }}
